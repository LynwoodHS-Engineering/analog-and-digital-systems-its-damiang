How I Solved This Problem 
1. I set up the VEX Brain, motor, shaft encoder, and kill switch to work together.
2. I wrote the code to move the motor based on the encoderâ€™s position and stop if the kill switch was pressed. 

The Hardest Parts of the Code 
1. I made sure the motor followed the encoder smoothly without delays.
2. I also ensured the kill switch stopped everything immediately when pressed.

Real-World Uses for This System 
1. A robotic arms in factories use encoders to move precisely when assembling products.
2. A prosthetic limbs track movement with encoders to help users move naturally.
